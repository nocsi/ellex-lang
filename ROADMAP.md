# Ellex Language Roadmap 🗺️

> A natural language programming environment for kids with AI-powered assistance

## Project Vision

Ellex aims to make programming accessible to young learners (ages 6-16) through natural language syntax, real-time feedback, and a progression path from simple commands to full Elixir development on the BEAM VM.
