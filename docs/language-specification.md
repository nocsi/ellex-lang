# Ellex Language Specification

## Overview

Ellex is a natural language programming environment designed specifically for kids (ages 6-16) with AI-powered assistance and modal editing. It combines the safety and fault-tolerance of the BEAM VM with intuitive natural language syntax, providing a pathway from simple natural language commands to full Elixir development.

## Design Principles

1. **Safety First**: Built-in execution limits, timeouts, memory constraints, and safe execution environment
2. **Natural Language Syntax**: Commands that read like English sentences
3. **Modal Programming**: Different modes for different types of interactions
4. **Progressive Learning**: Start with natural language, evolve to full programming languages
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate execution and visual feedback through turtle graphics
6. **AI-Powered Learning**: Intelligent assistance and suggestions

## Core Language Features

### Basic Statements

#### Tell Statement
The `tell` statement outputs text or values to the user.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
tell "message"
tell variable_name
tell 42
```

**Examples:**
```ellex
tell "Hello, world!"
tell "The answer is 42"
tell user_name
tell 3.14159
```

#### Ask Statement
The `ask` statement prompts the user for input and stores it in a variable.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
ask "question" ‚Üí variable_name
ask "question" ‚Üí variable_name as type_hint
```

**Examples:**
```ellex
ask "What's your name?" ‚Üí name
ask "How old are you?" ‚Üí age as number
ask "What's your favorite color?" ‚Üí color as string
```

**Type Hints:**
- `string`: Text input
- `number`: Numeric input
- `list`: List input

#### Repeat Statement
The `repeat` statement executes a block of code multiple times.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
repeat N times do
    statements...
end
```

**Examples:**
```ellex
repeat 3 times do
    tell "Hello!"
end

repeat 5 times do
    tell "Counting..."
    ask "Press enter to continue" ‚Üí continue
end
```

#### When Statement (Conditionals)
The `when` statement executes code based on conditions.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
when variable is value do
    statements...
end

when variable matches pattern do
    statements...
otherwise do
    statements...
end
```

**Examples:**
```ellex
when age is 16 do
    tell "You can drive!"
end

when color matches "blue" do
    tell "Blue is a nice color!"
otherwise do
    tell "That's a different color!"
end
```

#### Make Statement (Function Definition)
The `make` statement creates reusable functions.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
make function_name do
    statements...
end
```

**Examples:**
```ellex
make greet_user do
    ask "What's your name?" ‚Üí name
    tell "Hello, {name}!"
end

make count_to_ten do
    repeat 10 times do
        tell "Counting..."
    end
end
```

#### Function Calls
Execute previously defined functions by name.

**Examples:**
```ellex
greet_user
count_to_ten
```

### Data Types

#### String
Text values enclosed in double quotes.

**Examples:**
```ellex
"Hello, world!"
"This is a string with spaces"
"String with {variable} interpolation"
```

#### Number
Numeric values (integers and floating-point).

**Examples:**
```ellex
42
3.14159
-17
0.5
```

#### List
Collections of values.

**Examples:**
```ellex
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
["apple", "banana", "orange"]
[1, "hello", 3.14]
```

#### Nil
Represents empty or no value.

**Example:**
```ellex
nil
```

### String Interpolation

Variables can be embedded in strings using `{variable_name}` syntax.

**Examples:**
```ellex
ask "What's your name?" ‚Üí name
tell "Hello, {name}!"

ask "How old are you?" ‚Üí age
tell "You are {age} years old!"
```

### Comments

Comments start with `#` and continue to the end of the line.

**Examples:**
```ellex
# This is a comment
tell "Hello!" # This is also a comment

# You can have full-line comments
# that explain what the code does
```

## Modal Programming

Ellex supports different modes for different types of interactions:

### Listen Mode (@listen)
Exploration and discovery mode for understanding code.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
@listen do
    /tell                    # Explore the tell command
    around function_name     # Explore around a function
end
```

### Think Mode (@think)
Query and analysis mode for understanding code behavior.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
@think do
    what does greet_user do?
    where is name used?
end
```

### Build Mode (@build)
Creation and refactoring mode for modifying code.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
@build do
    rename old_name ‚Üí new_name
    extract 10,20 ‚Üí new_function
end
```

### Teach Mode (@teach)
Educational mode for learning and explanation.

**Syntax:**
```ellex
@teach do
    explain loops
    show examples of functions
end
```

## Turtle Graphics

Ellex includes built-in turtle graphics for visual programming:

```ellex
move forward 100
turn right 90
use color "red"
draw circle with radius 50
```

## Grammar Reference

The complete formal grammar is defined in `ellex.pest`:

```pest
program = { SOI ~ (statement | modal_block | service_block)* ~ EOI }
statement = { repeat_stmt | tell_stmt | ask_stmt | when_stmt | make_stmt | assignment | func_call }
tell_stmt = { "tell" ~ expression }
ask_stmt = { "ask" ~ expression ~ "‚Üí" ~ ident ~ ("as" ~ type_hint)? }
repeat_stmt = { "repeat" ~ integer ~ "times" ~ "do" ~ statement* ~ "end" }
# ... (see full grammar in ellex.pest)
```
